After Line #1 can function as an introduction or evaluation (like a manual) for your code is this specific repo

After line #5, please summarize what you have leaned about repos.

  Repos are like buckets with different code on github. Contains push and pull where if a version crashes, the push is the crash of an initial version. The pull is where a fork is created where there is the initial version and where there is the 1.1 version with a different set of code and these continue to build to the next version and the version history is where the different versions of websites are recorded.
